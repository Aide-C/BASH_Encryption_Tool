# BASH_Encryption_Tool

A text message encryption and decryption program to protect data from unauthorized access, which was a standalone project on LinkedIn Learning. The two main outcomes I aim to achieve throughout this project are improving my Bash scripting and encryption skills, which will enable me to showcase this project on my resume and in job interviews.

## Description 

As stated in the project brief, I needed to develop a bash-based encryption tool that implements a password with AES-256-cbc encryption used in the terminal. I imagined myself as a cybersecurity analyst at a tech company tasked with planning a realistic approach to this project. The encryption tool must be both simple and effective, supporting secure data handling across internal systems while being easily understood and utilized by employees. 
Using the scenario that I am a cybersecurity analyst at a tech company tasked with this project, it's obvious that the whole companyâ€™s internal system is at risk. Without data encryption in the internal system, it is vulnerable to data exfiltration from malware attacks, such as viruses and ransomware. Employee communications are exposed to phishing and man-in-the-middle attacks because they are not secured from the internet and threat actors. If there were a data leak or breach, the company would suffer severe financial loss and damage to its reputation among users.
